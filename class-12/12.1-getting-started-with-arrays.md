# 12.1 Getting Started with Arrays in PHP

This week, we're building a Student Grade Tracker project in order to learn more about arrays and array functions in PHP. Let's get started.

## Step 1: Basic Setup

Save a copy of `basic-page.php` as `index.php`.

## Step 2: Define the Student Array

Let's set up a multidimensional array. This is an associative array where each student's name is a key and the value is an indexed array containing the grades earned by that student.

```php
$students = [
  "Alice" => [85, 92, 78],
  "Bob" => [70, 88, 94],
  "Carol" => [90, 85, 87],
];
```

## Step 3: Display the Array

- Use `print_r()` and `pre` tags.

```php
echo "<pre>";
print_r($students);
echo "</pre>";
```

## Step 4: Define an Average Function**

Let's use the `array_sum()` function to calculate an average grade for each student.

```php
function getAverage($grades) {
  return array_sum($grades) / count($grades);
}
```

## Step 5: Loop Through and Display Averages

```php
foreach ($students as $name => $grades) {
  $average = getAverage($grades);
  echo "$name's average: $average<br>";
}
```

## Explanation:

- Use `array_sum()` to total the grades.
- Use `count()` to get the number of grades.

Now we can see each student’s average. Next, we’ll learn how to sort and search this data.
