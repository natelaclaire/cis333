# 12.7 Even More Array Functions

In this video, weâ€™ll explore seven powerful PHP array functions that help with comparing, sorting, and walking through arrays. These are extremely useful in real-world apps, especially when working with datasets like student lists, inventory, or search results.

---

## ðŸ§ª Examples and Use Cases

---

### **1. `array_diff()` â€“ Find Differences Between Arrays**

```php
$grades1 = [85, 90, 95];
$grades2 = [85, 88, 90];

$diff = array_diff($grades1, $grades2);
print_r($diff);
```

**Output:**  
Only `[95]` is in `$grades1` and not in `$grades2`.

**Use Case:**  
Compare two lists (e.g., students who submitted assignments vs. those enrolled).

---

### **2. `array_intersect()` â€“ Find Common Elements**

```php
$grades1 = [85, 90, 95];
$grades2 = [85, 88, 90];

$common = array_intersect($grades1, $grades2);
print_r($common);
```

**Output:**  
`[85, 90]`

**Use Case:**  
Check which students passed both a midterm and a final.

---

### **3. `array_walk()` â€“ Modify or Process Each Item**

```php
$grades = [70, 80, 90];

array_walk($grades, function (&$grade) {
  $grade += 5; // bonus points
});

print_r($grades);
```

**Output:**  
`[75, 85, 95]`

**Use Case:**  
Apply a transformation or apply rules to every element (e.g., curve grades, format display).

---

### **4. `array_multisort()` â€“ Sort Multiple Arrays Together**

```php
$names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"];
$averages = [88, 95, 90];

// Sort by averages descending, names will follow
array_multisort($averages, SORT_DESC, $names);

print_r($names);
print_r($averages);
```

**Output:**  
Sorted: Bob, Carol, Alice  
Averages: 95, 90, 88

**Use Case:**  
Sort students by grade while keeping their names aligned.

---

### **5. `natsort()` â€“ Natural Order Sorting (Case-Sensitive)**

```php
$items = ["item2", "item10", "item1"];
natsort($items);
print_r($items);
```

**Output:**  
`item1`, `item2`, `item10` (as humans expect)

**Use Case:**  
Sort filenames or titles that contain numbers.

---

### **6. `natcasesort()` â€“ Natural Order Sorting (Case-Insensitive)**

```php
$items = ["Item2", "item10", "item1"];
natcasesort($items);
print_r($items);
```

**Output:**  
Case doesnâ€™t matter â€” `Item1`, `item2`, `item10`

**Use Case:**  
Same as above, but more forgiving when casing is inconsistent.

---

### **7. `shuffle()` â€“ Randomize Array Order**

```php
$students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "Dave"];
shuffle($students);
print_r($students);
```

**Output:**  
Random order each time

**Use Case:**  
Randomize quiz questions, team pairings, or student presentations.

---

### ðŸ§© Bonus: Applying One to the Student Tracker

**Example:** Shuffle students for randomized presentation order:

```php
shuffle($students);
foreach ($students as $s) {
  echo $s['name'] . "<br>";
}
```

### **Outro:**

With these array tools in your toolbox, you can now analyze, sort, compare, and transform PHP arrays in really powerful ways. Combine these techniques with what weâ€™ve already built, and you're equipped to build real-world apps and dashboards.
