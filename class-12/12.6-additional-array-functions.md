# 12.6 Additional Array Functions

In this video, we’ll explore advanced array manipulation using PHP functions like `array_push()`, `array_pop()`, `array_shift()`, `array_unshift()`, and `array_splice()`. These are useful in many everyday coding situations, and we’ll apply them to our student grade tracker."

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step + Use Cases

We’ll use a single student’s grades to demonstrate:

```php
$grades = [85, 90, 78];
```

### **1. `array_push()` – Add to the End**

```php
array_push($grades, 92);
```

**Before:** `[85, 90, 78]`  
**After:** `[85, 90, 78, 92]`

**Use Case:**  
When you're logging entries, scores, or time-based data, and new items come in at the end (e.g., test scores over time).

### **2. `array_pop()` – Remove from the End**

```php
array_pop($grades);
```

**Before:** `[85, 90, 78]`  
**After:** `[85, 90]`

**Use Case:**  
Used in undo operations, backtracking, or managing a "last in, first out" (LIFO) structure like a stack.

### **3. `array_unshift()` – Add to the Beginning**

```php
array_unshift($grades, 88);
```

**Before:** `[85, 90, 78]`  
**After:** `[88, 85, 90, 78]`

**Use Case:**  
Great when the new item needs to be prioritized or processed first — like inserting a high-priority task at the top of a queue.

### **4. `array_shift()` – Remove from the Beginning**

```php
array_shift($grades);
```

**Before:** `[85, 90, 78]`  
**After:** `[90, 78]`

**Use Case:**  
Useful for queues (first in, first out), where you're processing items in the order they were received.

### **5. `array_splice()` – Insert or Remove Anywhere**

```php
array_splice($grades, 1, 0, 95); // Insert 95 at index 1
```

**Before:** `[85, 90, 78]`  
**After:** `[85, 95, 90, 78]`

Or remove the second grade:

```php
array_splice($grades, 1, 1); // Removes 90
```

**Use Case:**  
Best for editing mid-list values — inserting a grade correction, reordering steps, or slicing arrays in more complex ways.

### 🎯 **Applying to the Student Tracker**

#### Find a student and modify their grades:

```php
foreach ($students as $index => $student) {
  if ($student['name'] === "Alice") {
    array_push($students[$index]['grades'], 100);       // Add to end
    array_unshift($students[$index]['grades'], 70);     // Add to beginning
    array_splice($students[$index]['grades'], 2, 0, 85); // Insert at index 2
    break;
  }
}
```

### 📊 `array_combine()` Example

Create a simple student-to-average map:

```php
$names = [];
$averages = [];

foreach ($students as $student) {
  $names[] = $student['name'];
  $averages[] = getAverage($student['grades']);
}

$summary = array_combine($names, $averages);

foreach ($summary as $name => $avg) {
  echo "$name: $avg<br>";
}
```

**Use Case:**  
Perfect when creating lookup tables or reports where you need to match related values — like usernames and scores, product names and prices, etc.

### **Outro:**

You now know when and why to use some of PHP’s most useful array functions. They're essential tools in everything from game loops to APIs to data dashboards.
