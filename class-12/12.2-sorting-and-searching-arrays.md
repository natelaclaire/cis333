# 12.2 Sorting and Searching Arrays in PHP

In this video, we’ll sort students by their average grades and add a simple search feature.

## Step 1: Create an Averages Array

```php
$averages = [];
foreach ($students as $name => $grades) {
  $averages[$name] = getAverage($grades);
}
```

## Step 2: Sort by Average (Descending)

```php
arsort($averages);
```

`arsort()` sorts an array in descending order by value, maintaining the index-value relationship. Note that like the other array sorting functions, the array is passed to the function by reference not value. Remember that passing by reference means that we are giving the function direct access to the underlying variable rather than giving the function a copy of the variable's value. Consequently, the sorting functions modify the order of the array elements directly and don't need to return the modified array. This saves memory, but it means that we lose the prior order of the elements, so if you need to keep the prior order it's important to first make a copy of the array (a simple assignment statement such as `$averagesCopy = $averages` creates a copy).

By the way, `arsort()` always returns `true`, so we usually use it as shown here without capturing the returned value.

## Step 3: Display Sorted List

```php
foreach ($averages as $name => $avg) {
  echo "$name: $avg<br>";
}
```

## Step 4: Add a Search Form

```php
<form method="get">
  <input type="text" name="search" placeholder="Search name">
  <input type="submit" value="Search">
</form>
```

## Step 5: Process the Search

```php
if (isset($_GET['search'])) {
  $query = $_GET['search'];
  if (array_key_exists($query, $students)) {
    echo "$query's grades: " . implode(", ", $students[$query]);
  } else {
    echo "Student not found.";
  }
}
```

Great! Now we can sort students by performance and search by name. Let’s make the app more dynamic next time.
