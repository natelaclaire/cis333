# 1.1 Intro to GitHub Codespaces (Tutorial Script)

## Video Goal
Show students how to launch a GitHub Classroom assignment in GitHub Codespaces and create a simple `index.php` file.

## Estimated Length
4 to 6 minutes

## Prerequisites
- Students have accepted the GitHub Classroom assignment link.
- They can access GitHub in a browser.

## Script

### Opening (0:00-0:20)
**On-screen:** Course repo or classroom assignment list.

**Narration:**
Welcome! In this quick video, you will open your GitHub Classroom assignment in Codespaces and create your first PHP file.

### Step 1: Open the Assignment Repo (0:20-1:00)
**On-screen:** GitHub Classroom assignment page, then the created repo.

**Narration:**
After you accept the assignment, GitHub creates a new repository for you. Click the repository link to open it. You should see the file list for your assignment.

### Step 2: Create a Codespace (1:00-1:50)
**On-screen:** Click the green "Code" button, then "Codespaces", then "Create codespace on main".

**Narration:**
Click the green Code button, choose the Codespaces tab, and select Create codespace on main. GitHub will build a fresh development environment in your browser.

### Step 3: Locate the Project Files (1:50-2:20)
**On-screen:** VS Code in the browser, file explorer open.

**Narration:**
When Codespaces opens, you will see a VS Code editor in your browser. On the left is the file explorer for your repository.

### Step 4: Create index.php (2:20-3:20)
**On-screen:** New file in the explorer named `index.php`.

**Narration:**
In the file explorer, click New File and name it `index.php`. Now add this simple PHP content.

**On-screen text (code):**
```php
<?php
  echo "Hello, CIS 333!";
?>
```

**Narration:**
This script outputs a simple message when the file runs.

### Step 5: Save and Commit (3:20-4:30)
**On-screen:** Source Control panel, staged file, commit message.

**Narration:**
Codespaces saves automatically, but we still need to commit and push. Open the Source Control panel, stage `index.php`, write a short commit message like "Add index.php", and click Commit. Then click Sync or Push to send your changes to GitHub.

### Step 6: Verify on GitHub (4:30-5:00)
**On-screen:** GitHub repo showing `index.php` in the file list.

**Narration:**
Back in your browser tab for GitHub, refresh the repository. You should see `index.php` listed there. That means your work is saved and submitted.

### Wrap-Up (5:00-5:20)
**On-screen:** Repo file list.

**Narration:**
You have launched a Codespace, created your first PHP file, and pushed it to your assignment repo. In the next video, we will run PHP and see output in the terminal.

## Notes for Recording
- Keep the camera off-screen; focus on the browser and Codespaces UI.
- Zoom in slightly on the Code button and Source Control panel.
- Pause briefly after each major step for students to follow along.
