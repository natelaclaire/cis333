# 1.1 Intro to GitHub Codespaces

Welcome! In this quick video, you will open your GitHub Classroom assignment in GitHub Codespaces and create your first PHP file.

To begin an assignment, you need to accept it via the link provided in Brightspace. After you accept the assignment, GitHub creates a new repository for you. The URL for the repository, which I'll abbreviate repo from now on, will appear on the confirmation page. Click the repo link to open it. You should see the file list for your assignment.

Click the green Code button, choose the Codespaces tab, and select Create codespace on main. GitHub will build a fresh development environment in your browser that adheres to our specifications and requires no setup - no need to run anything on your own computer.

When Codespaces opens, you will see a Visual Studio Code editor in your browser, which I'll just call VS Code going forward. On the left is the file explorer for your repository.

In the file explorer, click the `public` folder to expand and select it, then click New File and name the file `index.php`, pressing Enter to confirm. Now add this simple PHP content:

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, CIS 333!";
?>
```

This script outputs a simple message when the file runs. Later in this week's videos, we will discuss the PHP syntax and what that all means.

Codespaces saves automatically, but we still need to commit and push. Open the Source Control panel, stage `index.php`, write a short commit message like "Add index.php", and click Commit. Then click Sync or Push to send your changes to GitHub.

Back in your browser tab for GitHub, refresh the repository. You should see next to the `public` folder a new commit message, indicating that this folder was impacted by a recent commit. Click `public` to view the contents and you'll find `index.php` listed there. That means your work is saved and submitted.

You have launched a Codespace, created your first PHP file, and pushed it to your assignment repo. You'll get a lot of practice with this in the weeks ahead. In the next video, we will run PHP and see output in the terminal.
