# 1.5 PHP Variables

In this video, we will learn what variables are, how to name them, and how to use them in PHP.

A variable is a named container for a value. In PHP, variables always start with a dollar sign. You can store text, numbers, and other data types, then reuse those values in your code.

Variable names must start with a dollar sign and a letter or underscore. After that, you can use letters, numbers, and underscores. Variable names are case-sensitive.

In this class, we will use camelCase, like `$firstName` or `$totalScore`, and avoid starting variable names with underscores since such variable names are reserved for special purposes - some examples are shown on page 20 in our textbook. You will also see other styles like StudlyCaps (`$TotalScore`) and snake_case (`$total_score`). PSR-1 says that whichever convention you choose, use it consistently across a project.

To create or update a variable, use the assignment operator `=`. The value on the right is stored in the variable on the left.

```php
<?php
$firstName = "Ada";
$lastName = "Lovelace";
$score = 95;

$score = $score + 5; // update the value
?>
```

This code creates three variables: `$firstName`, `$lastName`, and `$score`. The last line updates `$score` by adding 5 to its current value. We'll talked more about expressions and operators later in this week's videos.

You can use variables in expressions and output. Combine them with `echo` to build messages.

```php
<?php
$firstName = "Ada";
$score = 100;

echo "Student: ".$firstName;
echo " Score: ".$score;
?>
```

This prints a message by combining text and variables using string concatenation. Later, we will introduce cleaner formatting tools, but string concatenation works well for now.

As mentioned in the book, if you try to use a variable that hasn't been defined yet, PHP will issue a notice but continue running the script. And, since variable names are case sensitive, using a misspelled variable name is the same as using a different variable:

```php
<?php
$score = 90;
echo $Score; // Notice: Undefined variable: Score
?>
```

That's the basics of PHP variables: how to name them, assign values, and use them in your code. In the next video, we will explore constants.
