# 1.7 PHP Operators

In this video, we will define operators and operands, compare unary, binary, and ternary operators, and walk through the most common operators you will use in PHP.

An operator is a symbol that performs work on one or more values. The values are called operands. In `3 + 4`, the plus sign is the operator and the numbers are operands.

Operators are grouped by how many operands they use. Unary operators use one operand, like `-$score` or `++$count`. Binary operators use two operands, like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Ternary operators use three operands, most commonly the conditional operator `?:`.

```php
$neg = -$score;           // unary
$total = $a + $b;         // binary
$result = $ok ? "Yes" : "No"; // ternary
```

## Arithmetic Operators

PHP supports the standard arithmetic operators: addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, division `/`, modulus `%` for remainder, and exponentiation `**`.

```php
$sum = 5 + 2;
$diff = 5 - 2;
$product = 5 * 2;
$quotient = 5 / 2;
$remainder = 5 % 2;
$power = 2 ** 3;
```

## String Concatenation

As seen before, PHP uses the dot `.` operator to concatenate strings. This differs from many other languages, such as JavaScript, that use `+` for string concatenation and the dot operator for object member access.

```php
$fullName = $firstName . " " . $lastName;
```

## Combined Assignment Operators

Combined assignment operators update a variable in one step. They work with arithmetic and concatenation.

```php
$count += 1;   // same as $count = $count + 1
$total -= 5;   // same as $total = $total - 5
$price *= 1.1; // same as $price = $price * 1.1
$name .= " Jr."; // same as $name = $name . " Jr."
```

## Increment and Decrement

The increment and decrement operators are unary operators: `++` and `--`. You can place them before or after a variable. Prefix changes the value first and then returns the new value, suffix returns the old value and then changes it. In either case, the variable is updated.

```php
$score = 10;

$prefix = ++$score; // $score is now 11, $prefix is 11

$score = 10;
$suffix = $score++; // $score is now 11, $suffix is 10
```

## Operator Precedence

When you mix operators, PHP uses precedence rules to decide the order of evaluation. If you are unsure, use parentheses or check the official table: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.precedence.php.

In summary, operators do the work, operands are the values, and PHP gives you arithmetic, concatenation, combined assignment, and increment operators to build expressions quickly.
