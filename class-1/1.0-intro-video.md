# 1.0 Intro Video

Hello, and welcome to CIS 333. My name is Nate LaClaire, and I’ll be your instructor for Web Programming: PHP this semester.

A little about me. I’ve been a professional web developer since around 2000, and I’ve been working with PHP since the early days, even before that. Over the years, I’ve built a wide range of websites and web applications using PHP. I’m looking forward to sharing that experience with you, and also learning alongside you. I enjoy courses where there’s room for different perspectives, and programming courses are especially good for that.

This course is delivered fully online in an asynchronous format. That means there are no scheduled class meetings. Each week, you’ll find recorded videos and written instructions in Brightspace. As usual, the syllabus is located under Content, then Syllabus.

I want to spend a few minutes walking through the syllabus, explaining how the course works, and then we’ll look at this week’s assignment.

This is a hands-on course. You’ll gain both a theoretical foundation and practical skills for using PHP in web publishing and data management. We’ll also use some HTML and CSS, and possibly a small amount of JavaScript. Those technologies are standard when building web applications.

PHP is one of many backend technologies. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebAssembly run on the front end, while PHP runs on the server. Other backend languages you might encounter include Java, C#, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.

In this course, we’ll be building web pages directly with PHP. Many modern applications separate the backend and frontend using APIs, where the server sends data to a JavaScript-driven frontend rather than generating HTML directly. We’ll touch on that idea, but our main approach will be more traditional. It’s more accessible and easier to understand when you’re learning PHP for the first time.

The course relies on functional examples and structured lab activities to reinforce each concept.

In the syllabus, you’ll find my contact information, including email, phone number, and office location on the Augusta campus. I don’t have fixed office hours, but there’s a link to schedule an appointment. I’m happy to meet by Zoom, phone, or in person.

If you contact me during the week, you should expect a response within one business day. Messages sent on weekends or holidays are usually answered the next business day. If I’m unavailable for an extended period, I’ll let you know in advance.

Assignments submitted on time are typically graded within two to three days. Late work may take longer to grade.

All course communications go to your maine.edu email address, so make sure you’re checking it. If you have issues accessing that account, contact UMS IT.

Our textbook was published in December 2024 and is based on PHP 8. While there have been minor updates since then - 8.5 was released in November - the material we’ll cover is still accurate. If we need to address topics not covered in the book, I’ll provide supplemental materials.

For required software, you’ll need a free GitHub account. We’ll be using GitHub extensively, including GitHub Codespaces. Codespaces provides a browser-based development environment using Visual Studio Code and a shared container, so we’re all working in the same setup without publishing anything publicly.

The syllabus also outlines course objectives, learning outcomes, and required tools. If you have issues with Brightspace, contact the Student TechHub or UMS IT. If you have issues specific to GitHub, Codespaces, or course content, contact me directly.

Each week, you’ll read the assigned material, watch tutorial videos, complete activities, and submit assignments and quizzes as needed - each week there will be a set of Reinforcement Exercises and a short Quiz to submit. You should plan to spend about six to nine hours per week on this three-credit course.

All coding work is completed using GitHub repositories and Codespaces. You’ll either modify starter code or build projects from scratch, commit your changes, and submit your work through GitHub.

Assignments are generally due Monday night at 11:59 p.m., and the next week’s material opens Tuesday morning.

Reinforcement exercises are graded for correctness, so be sure to test your code before committing it.

We’ll also use GitHub’s automated tests. These are not your final grade, but they help you see whether your code meets basic requirements. Green checks mean tests passed; red means something failed. If you’re stuck, commit your work and contact me. I can open your repository, review your code, and give feedback.

Later in the semester, we’ll spend some time looking beyond PHP itself. We’ll discuss topics like SSH, SFTP, development versus production environments, hosting tools, and other workflows you may encounter in real projects.

You’ll also complete a final project. There’s a dedicated section in Brightspace with a video and detailed explanation. In week three, you’ll submit a project proposal, so review that material early and start thinking about ideas.

If you observe religious holidays that affect your ability to meet deadlines, let me know. I’m happy to work with you, but communication is important.

Please review the sections on grading, academic integrity, and the policy on generative AI. You may use AI tools for brainstorming or content creation, but not for writing code. If you use AI, include a brief statement describing how you used it.

One additional resource is Nomad PHP. I’ve arranged free access to their Growth Plan for students in this course. This includes videos, live talks, and certification materials. To participate, complete the short survey linked in Brightspace so I can provide you with access.

Each week we will have an overview video like this one, along with several short videos covering specific topics, as you see here for this week. The videos are usually between five and fifteen minutes long. You can pause, rewind, and rewatch them as needed and there will be written notes for each video that you can use as reference. You'll also have a reading assignment from the textbook each week.

Let's talk a little about this week's work. In video 1.1, you will learn how to set up GitHub Codespaces and create your first PHP file, which you'll learn how to run in video 1.2. In video 1.3, we'll cover PHP’s history and the organizations that maintain it. Video 1.4 begins discussing PHP syntax basics, which are expanded upon in the remaining videos. Once you've watched the videos and completed reading chapter 1 in the textbook, you'll work on this week's Reinforcement Exercises, which you will complete in GitHub Codespaces and commit to your assignment repository and then once you are done, you will submit the repository link. Then you'll complete the Comprehension Check Quiz. The exercises and quiz are due Monday night at 11:59 p.m.

I’m looking forward to the semester and working with you. If something isn’t clear, reach out. Feedback is always welcome. Have a great week!
