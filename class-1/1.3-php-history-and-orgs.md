# 1.3 PHP History and Organizations

In this video, we will define PHP, trace its short history, meet the organizations behind it, and introduce PHP Standards Recommendations, or PSRs.

PHP is a server-side scripting language used to build dynamic web pages. A web server runs PHP code, and the output is usually HTML sent back to the browser. PHP is widely used because it is approachable, flexible, and has a large ecosystem.

PHP began in 1994 as "Personal Home Page Tools" created by Rasmus Lerdorf. It evolved quickly into a general-purpose language for web development. Over the years, PHP added stronger object-oriented features, better performance, and modern tooling. Today, PHP powers many websites and frameworks.

The PHP Group is the community of core contributors who maintain the PHP language. They oversee development, releases, and the official php.net documentation. PHP is open source, which means anyone can contribute, but the PHP Group coordinates what ships in each release.

The PHP Foundation supports the long-term health of PHP by funding core development and infrastructure. It helps keep the language stable, secure, and evolving. Think of it as the organization that enables sustained work on PHP itself.

PHP Standards Recommendations, or PSRs, are community guidelines for writing PHP code consistently. They are coordinated by the PHP Framework Interop Group, also known as PHP-FIG. These standards help libraries and frameworks work together.

PSR-1 and PSR-12 cover basic and extended coding style. PSR-4 defines autoloading rules for classes. You will see these standards referenced in real-world projects, and following them makes your code easier to read and share. We'll be discussing these more in future lessons.

To recap: PHP is a server-side language for dynamic web pages, maintained by the PHP Group, supported by the PHP Foundation, and guided by PSRs from PHP-FIG. In the next video, we will start applying these ideas to our own code.
