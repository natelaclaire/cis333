# 1.2 Running PHP in Codespaces (Tutorial Script)

## Video Goal
Show students how to run `index.php` using the PHP CLI and a PHP development server in GitHub Codespaces.

## Estimated Length
5 to 7 minutes

## Prerequisites
- Students have a Codespace open for their GitHub Classroom assignment.
- `index.php` exists in the repository root.

## Script

### Opening (0:00-0:20)
**On-screen:** Codespaces editor with `index.php` visible.

**Narration:**
In this video, we will run our PHP script in two ways: directly in the terminal and through a local web server in Codespaces.

### Step 1: Open the Terminal (0:20-0:50)
**On-screen:** Terminal panel in VS Code.

**Narration:**
Start by opening the terminal. In Codespaces, you can use the Terminal menu and choose New Terminal.

### Step 2: Run with PHP CLI (0:50-2:00)
**On-screen:** Terminal prompt in the repo root.

**Narration:**
Make sure you are in the repository folder. Then run your script with the PHP CLI.

**On-screen text (command):**
```bash
php index.php
```

**Narration:**
You should see the output from the script right in the terminal. This is the quickest way to test PHP code without a browser.

### Step 3: Start the PHP Dev Server (2:00-3:40)
**On-screen:** Terminal command to start server.

**Narration:**
Now we will run the built-in PHP development server. Use this command in the terminal.

**On-screen text (command):**
```bash
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
```

**Narration:**
This starts a web server on port 8000. Leave this running while we open the site in a browser.

### Step 4: Open the Web Preview via Ports (3:40-5:00)
**On-screen:** Ports tab, forwarded port 8000, Open in Browser.

**Narration:**
In Codespaces, open the Ports tab. You should see port 8000 listed. Click Open in Browser to view your site. Your `index.php` file should load in the browser.

**On-screen text (URL hint):**
If needed, use the forwarded URL provided by the Ports tab.

### Step 5: Stop the Server (5:00-5:20)
**On-screen:** Terminal, press `Ctrl+C`.

**Narration:**
When you are finished, return to the terminal and press Control+C to stop the server.

### Wrap-Up (5:20-5:40)
**On-screen:** Browser view of the page, then back to editor.

**Narration:**
That is it. You ran PHP from the command line and through a web server in Codespaces. Next, we will start building more complex PHP pages.

## Notes for Recording
- Keep the terminal text large enough to read.
- Mention that the server must keep running while the browser is open.
- If the Ports tab is hidden, show how to open it from the VS Code panel menu.
