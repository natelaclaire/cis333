# 1.2 Running PHP in Codespaces

In this video, we will run our PHP script in two ways: directly in the terminal and through a local web server in Codespaces.

Start by opening the Terminal tab in the pane at the bottom of the window. If you don't see it, you can use the Terminal menu and choose New Terminal. You can access the menu by clicking the hamburger icon near the top-left corner, just below the VS Code logo.

Make sure you are in the repository folder. Then run your script with the PHP CLI, specifying the path to your `index.php` file after the `php` command.

```bash
php public/index.php
```

You should see the output from the script right in the terminal. This is the quickest way to test PHP code without a browser.

Now we will run the built-in PHP development server. Use this command in the terminal:

```bash
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t public
```

Alternatively, before running either of those commands, you can navigate to the `public` folder:

```bash
cd public
```

And then you don't need to specify the path when running the commands:

```bash
php index.php
```

or

```bash
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
```

This starts a web server on port 8000. Leave this running while we open the site in a browser.

In Codespaces, open the Ports tab. You should see port 8000 listed. Click Open in Browser to view your site. Your `index.php` file should load in the browser.

When you are finished, return to the terminal and press Control+C to stop the server.

That is it. You ran PHP from the command line and through a web server in Codespaces. Next, we will start building more complex PHP pages.
