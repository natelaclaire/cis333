# 1.4 PHP Syntax Basics

In this video, we will cover how PHP fits into HTML, the two PHP tag styles, statement endings, echo vs. print, and PHP comments.

PHP is designed to be embedded inside template text, usually HTML. Anything outside PHP tags is sent to the browser as-is. Anything inside PHP tags is executed on the server.

```php
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<?php
echo "Hello from PHP";
?>
```

PSR-1 allows two styles of PHP tags. The standard full tag is `<?php ... ?>`. The short echo tag is `<?= ... ?>`, which is a shorthand for echo. Other short tags (`<?`), which you might see in some documentation or scripts, are not allowed by PSR-1.

```php
<?php
$name = "CIS 333";
?>

<p><?= $name ?></p>
```

If a file contains only PHP code, the closing `?>` tag is optional. In fact, it is recommended to omit it to avoid accidental whitespace or output after the closing tag, which can cause headers to fail.

```php
<?php
// PHP-only file, no closing tag
$total = 42;
```

Most PHP statements must end with a semicolon. This tells PHP where one statement ends and the next begins.

`echo` and `print` are used to output text. Both are language constructs, not functions, so parentheses are optional. `echo` can output multiple values, and `print` returns 1, which makes it usable in expressions, though that is rare in practice. As the textbook notes, for our purposes, they are largely interchangeable. By the way, the textbook calls me "old" because I prefer `echo`. Because the book prefers `print`, I will try hard to remember to use it in my examples, but feel free to use either in your code.

```php
echo "Hello";
print "World";
```

PHP supports two common comment styles. Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* ... */` for block comments.

```php
// Single-line comment

/*
  Block comment
  spanning multiple lines
*/
```

We can use comments to explain our code, leave notes for ourselves or others, and temporarily disable code during testing.

That's some of the basics of PHP syntax. In the next video, we will build on this foundation to create more complex PHP scripts.
