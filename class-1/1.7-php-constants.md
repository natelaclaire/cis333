# 1.7 PHP Constants

In this video, we will define constants in PHP, look at naming rules, and use both built-in and custom constants.

A constant is a named value that does not change while your program runs. You use constants for values that should stay the same, like tax rates or site settings.

Constants do not use a dollar sign. By convention, they are written in all caps with underscores, like `MAX_SIZE` or `TAX_RATE`, referred to as upper snake case.

PHP includes many predefined constants. For example, `PHP_VERSION` tells you the current PHP version, `PHP_INT_MAX` gives the largest integer size, and magic constants like `__FILE__` tell you the current file path.

To define a constant, use the `define` function with a name and value.

```php
<?php
define("COURSE_NAME", "CIS 333");
define("CREDITS", 3);
?>
```

Once defined, you can use constants anywhere in your script, similar to how you might use a variable, without the dollar sign.

Here is a simple example that uses constants to output text.

```php
<?php
echo "Course: ".COURSE_NAME;
echo " (".CREDITS." credits)";
?>
```

Of course, since constants do not change, you cannot assign a new value to them after defining them. Attempting to do so will result in an error.

In summary, constants are fixed values, usually written in all caps, and defined with `define`. They help keep important values consistent across your code.
