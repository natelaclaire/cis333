# 3.5 Unicode Characters

In this video, we talk about Unicode characters in PHP strings. PHP strings
can contain Unicode characters directly, and you can also use `\u{...}`
escape sequences in double-quoted strings.

## Using Unicode Directly

If your file is saved in UTF-8, you can place Unicode characters directly
in a string.

```php
<?php
$greeting = "Hello, 世界";
print $greeting . PHP_EOL;
// Hello, 世界

$coffee = "café";
print $coffee . PHP_EOL;
// café
?>
```

This is the most readable approach, but it depends on your editor and file
encoding.

## Using Unicode Escapes

PHP supports [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters) code point escapes in double-quoted strings and heredoc strings using the `\u{...}` syntax.

```php
<?php
$smile = "\u{1F600}"; // 😀
$check = "\u{2714}";  // ✔
print $smile . PHP_EOL;
print $check . PHP_EOL;
?>
```

The value inside the braces is a hexadecimal code point. This can be useful when you want to avoid embedding non-ASCII characters directly in the file.

## Nowdoc and Single Quotes

Unicode escapes are not processed in single-quoted strings or nowdocs.

```php
<?php
$smile = '\u{1F600}';
print $smile . PHP_EOL;
// \u{1F600}
?>
```

## Encoding Reminder

Most editors save files as UTF-8 by default, but always confirm your file encoding if Unicode characters do not display correctly.
