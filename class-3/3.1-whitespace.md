# 3.1 Whitespace

In this class, we begin Chapter 3 of PHP Crash Course with a focus on strings
and string functions. Before we start using them, we need to be clear about
whitespace and how it behaves in PHP.

## Whitespace Outside of Strings

Outside of strings, PHP ignores extra spaces, tabs, and newlines. These two
statements are the same to the interpreter:

```php
<?php
$total = 5 + 10;
$total=5+10;
?>
```

Even though PHP ignores the extra whitespace, we should not. We will use
whitespace intentionally to make code readable.

## Whitespace Inside of Strings

Inside strings, whitespace is part of the value. Spaces, tabs, and newlines
are kept exactly as written.

```php
<?php
$label = "Total";
$labelWithSpace = "Total ";

var_dump($label);          // string(5) "Total"
var_dump($labelWithSpace); // string(6) "Total "
?>
```

The space at the end of "Total " changes the string length and the output.
That matters when you compare strings, build output, or store data.

## Indenting for Readability (PSR-12)

We will follow PSR-12 formatting rules in this course:

- Indent with 4 spaces per level.
- Never use tabs for indentation.
- Do not leave trailing whitespace at the end of lines.
- Write no more than one statement per line.

Here is a short example that follows these rules:

```php
<?php
if ($total > 0) {
    $message = "Items in cart";
    echo $message;
}
?>
```

## Spaces Around Operators

In this class, we will place spaces around operators for clarity. That
includes concatenation, arithmetic, assignment, and comparison operators.

```php
<?php
$firstName = "Ada";
$lastName = "Lovelace";
$fullName = $firstName . " " . $lastName;

$price = 19.99;
$total = $price * 2;

$isSame = $fullName == "Ada Lovelace";
?>
```

These whitespace choices do not change how PHP runs the code, but they make
it easier for humans to read, review, and maintain.
