# 3.2 String Literals and Escaping

In this video, we focus on how to write strings in PHP and how escaping works.
We will use single quotes, double quotes, and common escape sequences.

## Single-Quoted Strings

Single-quoted strings treat most characters literally. PHP only recognizes
two escape sequences inside single quotes: \' and \\.

```php
<?php
$path = '\\\\SERVERNAME\\files\\path\\file.txt';
print $path . PHP_EOL;
// \\SERVERNAME\files\path\file.txt

$quote = 'It\'s a nice day.';
print $quote . PHP_EOL;
// It's a nice day.
?>
```

Single quotes are a good default when you do not need variable interpolation
or special escape sequences.

## Double-Quoted Strings

Double-quoted strings allow escape sequences like \n and \t, and they also
interpolate variables.

```php
<?php
$name = "Alice";
$class = "CIS 333";
$message = "Hello, $name! Welcome to $class.\n";
print $message;
// Hello, Alice! Welcome to CIS 333.

$lines = "Line 1\nLine 2";
print $lines . PHP_EOL;
// Line 1
// Line 2
?>
```

When PHP sees a variable name inside double quotes, it replaces it with the
variable's value.

## Escaping Double Quotes

Inside double-quoted strings, escape a double quote with a backslash.

```php
<?php
$quote = "She said, \"Hello\"";
?>
```

Inside single-quoted strings, double quotes do not need escaping.

```php
<?php
$quote = 'She said, "Hello"';
?>
```

## Common Escape Sequences

Here are a few escape sequences you will use often in double-quoted strings:

- \n for a newline
- \t for a tab
- \\ for a literal backslash
- \" for a double quote

Remember, these escape sequences work in double-quoted strings. In
single-quoted strings, they are treated as plain characters.
