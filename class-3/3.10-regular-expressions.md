# 3.10 Regular Expressions

In this video, we introduce regular expressions (Regex) and PHP's PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) functions. Regex is a pattern language for matching and transforming text.

## Regex Basics

Regex patterns are written as strings and use delimiters like `/.../`.

```php
<?php
$pattern = "/cat/";
$text = "The cat sat.";
?>
```

## preg_match

`preg_match` checks if a pattern matches a string.

```php
<?php
$pattern = "/cat/";
$text = "The cat sat.";

if (preg_match($pattern, $text)) {
    echo "Match found" . PHP_EOL;
}
?>
```

## preg_match_all

`preg_match_all` finds all matches and returns a count.

```php
<?php
$pattern = "/\bcat\b/";
$text = "cat scatter cat";

$count = preg_match_all($pattern, $text, $matches);
print $count . PHP_EOL; // 2
var_dump($matches);
?>
```

## preg_replace

`preg_replace` replaces text that matches a pattern.

```php
<?php
$pattern = "/\s+/";
$text = "Too   much   space";

$clean = preg_replace($pattern, " ", $text);
echo $clean . PHP_EOL; // Too much space
?>
```

## preg_split

`preg_split` splits a string by a regex pattern.

```php
<?php
$text = "red, green; blue";
$parts = preg_split("/[,;]\s*/", $text);
var_dump($parts);
?>
```

## Pattern Flags

You can add flags after the delimiter. For example, `i` makes the match case-insensitive.

```php
<?php
$pattern = "/php/i";
$text = "PHP is fun";

if (preg_match($pattern, $text)) {
    echo "Match found" . PHP_EOL;
}
?>
```

Regex is powerful, but it is easy to overuse. Use it when a normal string function is not enough.

PCRE patterns are rich and complex. See the [PHP PCRE documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pcre.php) for more details and the [PCRE Pattern Syntax](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.syntax.php) section for the syntax you can use within the patterns.

There are a number of Web sites that provide regex testers and references and are great for learning, such as [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/).
