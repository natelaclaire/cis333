# 3.3 Concatenation and Interpolation

In this video, we practice combining strings with concatenation and
interpolating variables in double-quoted strings. We will also compare the
two approaches so you know when to use each.

## Concatenation with the Dot Operator

PHP uses the dot operator (.) to concatenate strings.

```php
<?php
$firstName = "Ada";
$lastName = "Lovelace";
$fullName = $firstName . " " . $lastName;
print $fullName . PHP_EOL;
// Ada Lovelace
?>
```

Concatenation is explicit and works the same in single or double quotes.

## Interpolation in Double Quotes

As we saw in the last video, double-quoted strings can interpolate variables directly.

```php
<?php
$firstName = "Ada";
$lastName = "Lovelace";
$message = "Welcome, $firstName $lastName";
print $message . PHP_EOL;
// Welcome, Ada Lovelace
?>
```

If the variable is next to other letters, use curly braces to avoid ambiguity.

```php
<?php
$openTime = "9:00";
$closeTime = "5:00";
$message = "We are open from {$openTime}am to {$closeTime}pm.";
print $message . PHP_EOL;
// We are open from 9:00am to 5:00pm.
?>
```

## Concatenation vs. Interpolation

Both styles are valid. Use the one that is clearest for the situation.

```php
<?php
$item = "notebook";
$count = 3;

$concatMessage = "You bought " . $count . " " . $item . "s";
$interpMessage = "You bought $count {$item}s";
print $concatMessage . PHP_EOL;
print $interpMessage . PHP_EOL;
// You bought 3 notebooks
// You bought 3 notebooks
?>
```

Concatenation can be easier to read when you are assembling a string from
pieces or adding function calls. Interpolation is clean for simple strings.

## Interpolation Practice

Try these examples and compare the output.

```php
<?php
$language = "PHP";
$version = 8;

echo "We are learning $language $version";
echo "\n";

echo "We are learning " . $language . " " . $version;
echo "\n";
?>
```

These two outputs are the same. The choice is about clarity and style.
