## Exercise 3-1: String Literals and Escaping

In this exercise, you will define strings using single quotes, double quotes,
and escape sequences.

1. Open `public/exercises/3-1-string-literals.php`.
2. Create the `$path`, `$quote`, and `$multiline` variables as described in
   the comments.
3. Run the script and confirm the output matches the expected output in the
   file.

## Exercise 3-2: Concatenation and Interpolation

In this exercise, you will combine strings using concatenation and
interpolation.

1. Open `public/exercises/3-2-concat-interpolation.php`.
2. Build `$fullName` using concatenation.
3. Build `$message` using interpolation with curly braces where needed.
4. Run the script and confirm the output matches the expected output in the
   file.

## Exercise 3-3: Heredoc and Nowdoc

In this exercise, you will create multi-line strings using heredoc and
nowdoc.

1. Open `public/exercises/3-3-heredoc-nowdoc.php`.
2. Build `$heredocMessage` using heredoc with interpolation and a newline.
3. Build `$nowdocMessage` using nowdoc so the content is literal.
4. Run the script and confirm the output matches the expected output in the
   file.

## Exercise 3-4: Core String Functions

In this exercise, you will use `strpos`, `substr`, `str_replace`, and
`substr_replace` to transform strings.

1. Open `public/exercises/3-4-string-functions.php`.
2. Complete the TODOs to compute `$domain`, `$masked`, and `$withDash`.
3. Run the script and confirm the output matches the expected output in the
   file.

## Exercise 3-5: Multibyte and Regex Basics

In this exercise, you will use `mb_*` functions and PREG helpers.

1. Open `public/exercises/3-5-mb-and-regex.php`.
2. Use `mb_strlen` to count characters in a Unicode string.
3. Use `preg_replace` to normalize whitespace.
4. Use `preg_match` with a case-insensitive pattern.
5. Run the script and confirm the output matches the expected output in the
   file.
