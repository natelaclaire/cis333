# 2.7 Class 2 Assignments

## Exercise 2-1: Scalar Types

In this exercise, you will create variables for each PHP scalar type and confirm their types.

1. Open `class-2/starter-files/2-1-scalar-types.php`.
2. Create variables named `$age`, `$price`, `$name`, and `$isActive` with integer, float, string, and boolean values, respectively.
3. Run the script and confirm the output matches the expected types shown in the file.

## Exercise 2-2: Type Checks

In this exercise, you will use `is_numeric` and `ctype_digit` to count values.

1. Open `class-2/starter-files/2-2-type-checks.php`.
2. Use `is_numeric` to count how many inputs are numeric and store the result in `$numericCount`.
3. Use `ctype_digit` to count how many inputs contain only digits and store the result in `$digitCount`.
4. Use the ternary operator and `+=` as directed in the comments.
5. Run the script and confirm the output matches the expected result.

## Exercise 2-3: NULL vs. Unset

In this exercise, you will compare a NULL variable to an unset variable.

1. Open `class-2/starter-files/2-3-null-vs-unset.php`.
2. Use `isset` to set `$colorIsSet` and `$shapeIsSet`.
3. Use `is_null` to set `$colorIsNull`.
4. Run the script and confirm the output matches the expected result.

## Exercise 2-4: Check Type and Cast

In this exercise, you will check a random quotient and cast it to different types.

1. Open `class-2/starter-files/2-4-check-type-and-cast.php`.
2. Use `is_int` and `is_float` to set `$isInteger` and `$isFloat`, respectively, based on `$quotient`.
3. Cast `$quotient` to integer and float and store the results in `$asInteger` and `$asFloat`.
4. Run the script multiple times. The values will change because of randomness, but the output format should match the example in the file.

## Exercise 2-5: Truthy and Falsy

In this exercise, you will choose truthy and falsy values.

1. Open `class-2/starter-files/2-5-truthy-and-falsy.php`.
2. Update the `$truthy*` variables so each one is truthy and different from the others.
3. Update the `$falsy*` variables so each one is falsy and different from the others.
4. Run the script and confirm the output shows five `true` values followed by five `false` values.
