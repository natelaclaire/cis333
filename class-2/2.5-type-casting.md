# 2.5 Type Casting

In this video, we will learn how to cast values to different types in PHP and why explicit casting can prevent bugs.

Type casting is when you explicitly convert a value to a different type. This is useful when you want to be clear and predictable about how a value is used.

You can cast to integer or float using parentheses. This forces the value into a numeric type.

```php
<?php
$countText = "12";
$count = (int) $countText; // 12

$priceText = "19.99";
$price = (float) $priceText; // 19.99
?>
```

Casting returns a converted value without changing the original variable. `settype()` changes the variable in place and returns `true` or `false` for success. Use casting when you want a one-off conversion and `settype()` when you want to update the variable itself.

```php
<?php
$value = "123";
$asInt = (int) $value; // $value is still a string

settype($value, "int"); // $value is now an integer
var_dump($value); // int(123)
?>
```

Casting to string is helpful when building output. Casting to boolean is common for flags and condition checks.

```php
<?php
$score = 100;
$scoreText = (string) $score;

$hasItems = (bool) 3;  // true
$hasItems = (bool) 0;  // false
?>
```

PHP also provides `*val()` functions like `intval`, `floatval`, `strval`, and `boolval`. These return the converted value without changing the original variable, similar to casting, but in function form.

```php
<?php
$text = "45";
$num = intval($text); // 45
$price = floatval("9.99"); // 9.99
$flag = boolval(1); // true
?>
```

Most user input arrives as strings. Casting is one way to turn that input into the type you need, but you should still validate it before using it in calculations.

```php
<?php
$qtyText = "5";
$qty = (int) $qtyText;
$total = $qty * 9.99; // 49.95
?>
```

Casting does not fix bad input. If the string is not numeric, casting to an int will give you 0. Validate first, then cast.

Type casting makes conversions explicit. Use it to control how values behave and to avoid relying on automatic type juggling.
