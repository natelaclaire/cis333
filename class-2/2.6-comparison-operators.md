# 2.6 Comparison Operators

In this video, we will cover PHP comparison operators and how they behave with different data types.

PHP includes both loose and strict comparisons. Loose comparisons use `==` and `!=` (or `<>`), which allow type juggling. Strict comparisons use `===` and `!==`, which require both value and type to match.

```php
<?php
var_dump(5 == "5");   // true
var_dump(5 != "5");   // false
var_dump(5 <> "5");   // false

var_dump(5 === "5");  // false
var_dump(5 !== "5");  // true
?>
```

Relational operators compare values to see which is greater or smaller. These are commonly used in conditionals.

```php
<?php
$score = 88;

var_dump($score > 90);  // false
var_dump($score >= 88); // true
var_dump($score < 70);  // false
var_dump($score <= 88); // true
?>
```

The spaceship operator `<=>` compares two values and returns -1, 0, or 1. It returns -1 if the left value is smaller, 0 if they are equal, and 1 if the left value is larger. It is often used for sorting.

```php
<?php
var_dump(3 <=> 5); // -1
var_dump(5 <=> 5); // 0
var_dump(7 <=> 5); // 1
?>
```

Because `==` and `!=` allow type juggling, you can get surprising results. When possible, prefer strict comparisons with `===` and `!==`.

Use `==`, `!=`, or `<>` for loose comparisons, `===` and `!==` for strict checks, relational operators for ranges, and `<=>` when you need a three-way comparison.
