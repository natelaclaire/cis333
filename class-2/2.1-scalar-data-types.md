# 2.1 Scalar Data Types

In this video, we will cover the four scalar data types in PHP: integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

Scalar types are single values, not collections. PHP’s scalar types are integer, float, string, and boolean.

Integers are whole numbers with no decimal point. Use them for counts, ages, and IDs.

```php
<?php
$age = 20;
$itemsInCart = 3;
?>
```

Floats are numbers with decimals. Use them for measurements, prices, or averages.

```php
<?php
$price = 19.99;
$averageScore = 87.5;
?>
```

Strings are sequences of characters. You can create them with double or single quotes.

```php
<?php
$firstName = "Ada";
$lastName = 'Lovelace';
?>
```

We will dig into strings more in the next module, but for now, just remember that strings store text.

Booleans represent true or false values. They are often used in conditionals.

```php
<?php
// true and false are keywords in PHP
$isLoggedIn = true;
$hasDiscount = false;

// The following strings are not equivalent to the booleans above
$isLoggedInString = "true";
$hasDiscountString = "false";
?>
```

Note that there is a difference between "true" (a string) and true (a boolean). The same goes for "false" and false.

If you are unsure about a value, you can check its type. `gettype` returns a string, and `var_dump` shows the value and type together.

```php
<?php
$price = 19.99;
echo gettype($price); // double

var_dump($price); // float(19.99)
?>
```

Integers, floats, strings, and booleans are the scalar data types in PHP. We will use them constantly, so make sure you recognize each one.
