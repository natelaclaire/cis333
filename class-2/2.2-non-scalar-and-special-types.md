# 2.2 Non-Scalar and Special Types

In this video, we will briefly cover PHP’s non-scalar and special types, then take a closer look at NULL.

Non-scalar, or compound, types hold collections or complex values. PHP includes four: arrays, objects, callables, and iterables. We will focus on arrays and objects later in the course.

- Arrays: ordered collections of values.
- Objects: data + behavior grouped together.
- Callables: values that can be invoked like a function.
- Iterables: values you can loop over.

PHP also defines two special types: resource and NULL. Resources represent external handles like files or database connections. NULL represents the absence of a value, and that is the one we will dig into now.

A NULL value means no value at all. It is different from an empty string or zero. You will see NULL when a variable is unset, when a function returns nothing, or when you explicitly assign NULL.

```php
<?php
$nickname = null;
?>
```

There is a subtle difference between an unset variable and a variable that is set to NULL. An unset variable does not exist. A variable set to NULL exists but has no value.

`isset` returns false with no warning for both cases, but `is_null` will cause a warning if the variable doesn't exist and therefore should only be used if the variable exists. Use `isset` to check if a variable is set, and use `is_null` when you know it exists.

```php
<?php
// Unset variable
// $color is never defined
var_dump(isset($color));   // false
var_dump(is_null($color)); // true (with a notice if not defined)

// Explicit NULL
$color = null;
var_dump(isset($color));   // false
var_dump(is_null($color)); // true
?>
```

You can remove a variable entirely with `unset`. This makes it undefined again, which can be useful when you want to release a value or avoid accidentally reusing it.

```php
<?php
$token = "abc123";
unset($token); // $token no longer exists
?>
```

As the book explains, trying to access `$token` after calling `unset` or when it has not yet been defined will produce a warning, while trying to access a variable with an explicitly-set NULL value will not.

PHP has four compound types and two special types. NULL represents the absence of a value, and it behaves differently depending on whether a variable is unset or explicitly set to NULL.
