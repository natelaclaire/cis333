# 6.1 Constructing Text Strings

Strings are a fundamental data type in PHP, used to represent text. This tutorial will cover:

- String Operators
- Escape Sequences
- Simple String Syntax
- Complex String Syntax

---

## 1. String Operators

### Concatenation Operator (`.`)

The `.` operator is used to join two or more strings.

```php
$name = "John";
$greeting = "Hello, " . $name . "!";
echo $greeting; // Output: Hello, John!
```

### Concatenation Assignment Operator (`.=`)

The `.=` operator appends the right string to the left string.

```php
$message = "Hello";
$message .= " World!";
echo $message; // Output: Hello World!
```

#### Exercise 3-1, Page 127

```php
$musicalScale = ["do", "re", "mi", "fa", "so", "la", "ti"];
$outputString = "The notes of the musical scale are: ";
foreach ($musicalScale as $currentNote)
     $outputString .= " " . $currentNote;
echo "<p>$outputString</p>";
```

## 2. Escape Sequences

Escape sequences allow you to insert special characters into strings.

| Escape Sequence | Description       |
|------------------|------------------|
| `\n`            | New line         |
| `\t`            | Tab              |
| `\"`            | Double quote     |
| `\\`            | Backslash        |
| `\$`            | Dollar sign      |

### Example:

```php
echo "Line 1\nLine 2"; // Outputs:
// Line 1
// Line 2

echo "\"Quoted text\""; // Output: "Quoted text"
```

### Exercise 3-2, Page 130-131

```php
$displayValue=9.876;
echo "<pre>\n";
echo "Unformatted text line 1. ";
echo "Unformatted text line 2. ";
echo "$displayValue = $displayValue";
echo "</pre>\n";
echo "<pre>\n";
echo "Formatted text line 1. \r\n";
echo "\tFormatted text line 2. \r\n";
echo "\$displayValue = $displayValue";
echo "</pre>\n";
```

*Note: Escape sequences work differently in single and double-quoted strings.*

## 3. Simple String Syntax

PHP has two ways to define strings: single-quoted (`'`) and double-quoted (`"`).

### Single-Quoted Strings

- Interprets text literally (no variable interpolation)
- Only `\'` and `\\` are recognized

```php
$name = "John";
echo 'Hello, $name'; // Output: Hello, $name
echo 'It\'s a sunny day!'; // Output: It's a sunny day!
```

### Double-Quoted Strings

- Interpolates variables and recognizes escape sequences

```php
$name = "John";
echo "Hello, $name"; // Output: Hello, John
echo "New line here:\nNext line."; // New line is interpreted
```

*Tip:* For complex variable expressions, use curly braces to avoid confusion.

```php
$user = "John";
echo "Hello, {$user}Doe!"; // Output: Hello, JohnDoe!
```

---

## 4. Complex String Syntax

When you need more than simple variable interpolation, PHP provides complex syntax by using braces.

### Array Elements in Strings

```php
$person = ["first" => "John", "last" => "Doe"];
echo "Hello, {$person['first']}!"; // Output: Hello, John!
```

### Object Properties in Strings

```php
class Person {
    public $name = "John";
}

$person = new Person();
echo "Hello, {$person->name}!"; // Output: Hello, John!
```

### Function Calls in Strings

Function calls are not allowed directly inside strings, but you can concatenate:

```php
echo "Today's date: " . date('Y-m-d'); // Output: Today's date: 2025-02-17
```

### Exercise 3-3, Page 132-133

```php
$books = ["The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn",
     "Nineteen Eighty-Four",
     "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland",
     "The Cat in the Hat"];
$authors = ["Mark Twain",
     "George Orwell",
     "Lewis Carroll",
     "Dr. Seuss"];
$realNames = ["Samuel Clemens",
     "Eric Blair",
     "Charles Dodson",
     "Theodor Geisel"];
For ($i = 0; $i < count($books); ++$i) 
     echo "<p>The real name of {$authors[$i]}, ".
          "the author of \"{$books[$i]}\", ".
          "is {$realNames[$i]}.</p>";
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use single quotes when no interpolation is needed** for slightly better performance.
2. **Use curly braces for complex variables** to improve readability.
3. **Avoid excessive string concatenation** when possible by using interpolation.
4. **Escape special characters properly** to prevent unexpected behavior.

By understanding PHP string construction, you can efficiently handle text in your applications. Practice these concepts to build robust, readable, and maintainable code.
