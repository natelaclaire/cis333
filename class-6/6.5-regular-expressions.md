# 6.5 Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for searching, matching, and manipulating strings in PHP. PHP provides Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) functions to handle regex efficiently.

## 1. **What are Regular Expressions?** - 2025-02-20 16-30-35.mkv - 6.17

Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They are widely used for validation, parsing, and text processing.

### **Basic Syntax**

- `/pattern/` – A regex pattern is enclosed in delimiters (`/` is commonly used).
- `^` – Matches the start of a string.
- `$` – Matches the end of a string.
- `.` – Matches any single character except newline.
- `*` – Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding character.
- `+` – Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding character.
- `?` – Matches 0 or 1 occurrence.
- `[]` – Character classes to match specific characters.
- `|` – Acts as OR operator.

### **Example Regex Patterns**

```php
$pattern = "/^hello/"; // Matches strings starting with "hello"
$pattern = "/[0-9]+/"; // Matches any sequence of digits
$pattern = "/php|python/"; // Matches "php" or "python"
```

## 2. **Using PCRE Functions in PHP** - 2025-02-20 16-49-09.mkv and 2025-02-20 17-08-48.mkv and 2025-02-20 17-26-41.mkv - 6.18

PHP provides several functions to work with regular expressions:

### **`preg_match()` – Find a Match**

Finds if a pattern exists in a string.

```php
$pattern = "/hello/";
$string = "hello world";
if (preg_match($pattern, $string)) {
    echo "Match found!";
} else {
    echo "No match found.";
}
```

### **`preg_match_all()` – Find All Matches**

Finds all occurrences of a pattern in a string.

```php
$pattern = "/[0-9]+/";
$string = "Order 123, Item 456";
preg_match_all($pattern, $string, $matches);
print_r($matches[0]);
```

**Output:**

```
Array ( [0] => 123 [1] => 456 )
```

### **`preg_replace()` – Replace Matches** - 2025-02-20 17-31-03.mkv - 6.19

Replaces occurrences of a pattern with another string.

```php
$pattern = "/apple/";
$replacement = "banana";
$string = "I love apple pie.";
echo preg_replace($pattern, $replacement, $string);
```

**Output:**

```
I love banana pie.
```

### **`preg_split()` – Split String by Pattern** - 2025-02-20 17-38-59.mkv - 6.20

Splits a string into an array based on a regex pattern.

```php
$pattern = "/,\s*/";
$string = "apple, banana, cherry";
$result = preg_split($pattern, $string);
print_r($result);
```

**Output:**

```
Array ( [0] => apple [1] => banana [2] => cherry )
```

### **`preg_grep()` – Filter an Array** - 2025-02-20 17-42-37.mkv - 6.21

Filters an array, returning elements that match the pattern.

```php
$pattern = "/^J/";
$names = ["John", "Jane", "Paul", "Jake"];
$filtered = preg_grep($pattern, $names);
print_r($filtered);
```

**Output:**

```
Array ( [0] => John [1] => Jane [3] => Jake )
```

## 3. **Regular Expression Modifiers** - 2025-02-20 17-47-03.mkv - 6.22

Modifiers change how a pattern is interpreted:

- `i` – Case-insensitive matching (`/hello/i` matches "Hello" and "hello").
- `m` – Multiline mode (`^` and `$` match start/end of each line).
- `s` – Allows `.` to match newline characters.
- `u` – Enables Unicode matching.

Example:

```php
$pattern = "/hello/i";
$string = "Hello World";
echo preg_match($pattern, $string) ? "Match!" : "No match!";
```

**Output:**

```
Match!
```

## 4. **Escaping Special Characters** - 2025-02-20 17-52-40.mkv - 6.23

Some characters have special meanings in regex (`. ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | /`). Escape them with `\`.

```php
$pattern = "/\.com/";
$string = "example.com";
echo preg_match($pattern, $string) ? "Match!" : "No match!";
```

---

## 5. **Best Practices for Using Regex in PHP**

1. **Use regex only when necessary** – Simple string functions (`strpos()`, `str_replace()`) are often faster.
2. **Test patterns before using them in production** – Tools like [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) help debug regex.
3. **Be mindful of performance** – Complex patterns can be slow on large strings.
4. **Escape user inputs in regex patterns** – Prevent unexpected behavior by using `preg_quote()`.

By mastering PCRE functions in PHP, you can effectively search, validate, and manipulate strings with powerful pattern matching techniques.
