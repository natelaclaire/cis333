# 10.1 Working with Files and Directories in PHP: Binary vs. Text Files and File Permissions

This week, we’re diving into how PHP works with files and directories. You'll learn about two key topics:

1. The difference between **text files** and **binary files**
2. How **file permissions** work in a typical web server environment

---

## **1. Text Files vs. Binary Files**

### **Text Files**
A text file is a file that contains only human-readable characters. Each line ends with a newline character (`\n` on Linux, `\r\n` on Windows). Examples include `.txt`, `.csv`, `.html`, and `.php`.

PHP handles text files easily because it can interpret and display the content directly.

**Example:**
```php
$handle = fopen("example.txt", "r");
$content = fread($handle, filesize("example.txt"));
fclose($handle);

echo $content;
```

This reads the file and prints the content as-is.

### **Binary Files**
A binary file contains data that isn't meant to be human-readable. This includes images, videos, audio files, and executable programs. These files must be handled carefully—read and written in binary mode.

**Example:**
```php
$handle = fopen("image.jpg", "rb");
$content = fread($handle, filesize("image.jpg"));
fclose($handle);

// Do something with $content, like outputting it with the right header
header("Content-Type: image/jpeg");
echo $content;
```

### **File Modes**
When opening files, the mode you use matters. Common modes include:

| Mode | Description                      |
|------|----------------------------------|
| "r"  | Read-only, starts at beginning   |
| "w"  | Write-only, truncates file       |
| "a"  | Write-only, appends to file      |
| "rb" | Read-only in binary mode         |
| "wb" | Write-only in binary mode        |

## **2. File Permissions**

File permissions control who can read, write, or execute a file. This is especially important in web environments, where PHP runs as a user with limited rights.

### **Linux File Permissions**

Each file has three permission groups:

- **Owner**
- **Group**
- **Others**

Permissions include:

- **r** (read)
- **w** (write)
- **x** (execute)

### **Numeric Notation**
Permissions are often represented with three digits (e.g., `644`, `755`):

- `4` = read
- `2` = write
- `1` = execute

**Examples:**

| Code | Meaning                |
|------|------------------------|
| 644  | Owner can read/write; others read-only |
| 755  | Owner can read/write/execute; others read/execute |
| 777  | Everyone can read/write/execute (not safe for web files) |

You can change permissions using PHP:

```php
chmod("example.txt", 0644);
```

> Note: This may not work if the web server user doesn’t own the file.

### **Checking Permissions**

Use `is_readable()` and `is_writable()` to check access:

```php
if (is_readable("example.txt")) {
    echo "File is readable";
}

if (is_writable("example.txt")) {
    echo "File is writable";
}
```

## **Summary**

- Use text mode (`"r"`, `"w"`, etc.) for plain text files; use binary mode (`"rb"`, `"wb"`, etc.) for non-text files.
- File permissions matter. If PHP can’t read or write a file, check the file’s permission settings.
- Always validate permissions before attempting file operations to avoid runtime errors.
