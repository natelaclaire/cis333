# 8.1 PHP Superglobals (pages 189-191)

In PHP, **superglobals** or **autoglobals** are built-in variables that are available in all scopes of a script. These variables store important data related to user input, sessions, cookies, server details, and more.

## List of PHP Superglobals (page 189):

1. `$_GET`
2. `$_POST`
3. `$_REQUEST`
4. `$_SERVER`
5. `$_FILES`
6. `$_SESSION`
7. `$_COOKIE`
8. `$_ENV`
9. `$GLOBALS`

---

## 1. `$_GET`

The `$_GET` superglobal is used to collect form data sent via the **GET** method or URL parameters.

**Example:**

```php
// URL: example.com/index.php?name=John&age=25
echo "Name: " . $_GET["name"] . "<br>";
echo "Age: " . $_GET["age"];
```

- Data is visible in the URL.
- Limited to 2048 characters.

---

## 2. `$_POST`

The `$_POST` superglobal collects form data sent via the **POST** method. It is more secure than `$_GET` since data is not exposed in the URL.

**Example:**

```php
<form method="POST">
    Name: <input type="text" name="name">
    <input type="submit">
</form>

<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    echo "Hello, " . $_POST["name"];
}
?>
```

- Suitable for sending large and sensitive data.

---

## 3. `$_REQUEST`

The `$_REQUEST` superglobal can retrieve both `$_GET` and `$_POST` values. Optionally, it can also include `$_COOKIE` values, but that is no longer the default behavior. Note that in the case of name collisions (where `$_GET` and `$_POST` contain the same key), `$_REQUEST` might not always contain what you expected (the request_order and variables_order configuration directives control the precedence).

**Example:**

```php
$name = $_REQUEST["name"]; // Works with both GET and POST
echo "Hello, " . $name;
```

- Itâ€™s convenient but can introduce security risks if misused.

---

## 4. `$_SERVER`

The `$_SERVER` superglobal holds information about the server and execution environment.

**Example:**

```php
echo "Server Name: " . $_SERVER["SERVER_NAME"] . "<br>";
echo "Request Method: " . $_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] . "<br>";
echo "User Agent: " . $_SERVER["HTTP_USER_AGENT"];
```

**Common `$_SERVER` Variables:**

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `$_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]` | Current script name |
| `$_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"]` | GET or POST request method |
| `$_SERVER["SERVER_NAME"]` | Server hostname |
| `$_SERVER["HTTP_USER_AGENT"]` | Browser details |

---

## 5. `$_FILES`

The `$_FILES` superglobal handles file uploads. We'll be talking about this in chapter 5.

---

## 6. `$_SESSION`

The `$_SESSION` superglobal stores data across multiple pages. We'll discuss this in detail in CIS 334.

---

## 7. `$_COOKIE`
Cookies store small pieces of data on the clientâ€™s browser. We'll discuss this in detail in CIS 334.

---

## 8. `$_ENV`

The `$_ENV` superglobal contains environment variables.

**Example:**

```php
echo "Path: " . $_ENV["PATH"];
```

- Often populated via the server configuration.

---

## 9. `$GLOBALS`

We already discussed the `$GLOBALS` superglobal, which allows access to global variables from anywhere.

---

## Conclusion
PHP superglobals provide powerful tools for handling user input, managing sessions, and accessing server information. However, they should be used carefully to avoid security risks like **SQL Injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).** Always **sanitize** and **validate** user input before processing it.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
