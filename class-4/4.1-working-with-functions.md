# 4.1 Working with Functions

---

## **Introduction**

Hi everyone! In this video, we’re going to dive into working with functions in PHP. Functions are a crucial part of writing reusable and maintainable code. We'll cover defining functions, calling them, returning values, and passing parameters by reference. Let's get started!

---

## **1. Defining Functions**

Functions in PHP allow us to encapsulate logic and reuse it throughout our code. We define a function using the `function` keyword. Let's see an example:

```php
function greet(): void {
    echo "Hello, welcome to PHP functions!";
}
```

This function, `greet()`, doesn’t take any arguments and returns nothing. Instead, it simply prints a message to the screen.

---

## **2. Calling Functions**

Once we define a function, we can call it by using its name followed by parentheses:

```php
greet();
```

This will output:

```
Hello, welcome to PHP functions!
```

It’s that simple!

---

## **3. Returning Values**

Functions can also return values instead of just printing them. This allows for greater flexibility in our programs.

```php
function add(int $a, int $b): int {
    return $a + $b;
}
```

Here, `add()` takes two integers and returns their sum. The `int` type declarations ensure both parameters and the return value are integers.

To use the function:

```php
$result = add(5, 3);
echo "The sum is: $result";
```

This will output:

```
The sum is: 8
```

---

## **4. Passing Parameters by Reference**

By default, function parameters are passed by value, meaning a copy of the variable is used inside the function. If we want to modify the original variable, we can pass it by reference using the `&` symbol:

```php
function increaseValue(int & $number): void {
    $number++;
}
```

Here’s how we use it:

```php
$value = 10;
increaseValue($value);
echo "Updated value: $value";
```

This will output:

```
Updated value: 11
```

By using `&`, we allow the function to modify the original `$value` variable.

## **Conclusion**

And that’s a wrap! We covered how to define and call functions, return values, and pass parameters by reference. Functions help us write cleaner, more efficient PHP code. Try experimenting with your own functions and see how they can make your code more modular and reusable.
