# 4.7 Iteration Using `do...while` Statements

---

## **Introduction**

In our previous video, we explored iteration using `while` loops. Next we’re going to focus on another type of loop in PHP: the `do...while` loop. This loop ensures that the code executes at least once before checking the condition. Let’s get started!

---

## **1. Understanding `do...while` Loops**

A `do...while` loop is similar to a `while` loop, but it guarantees at least one execution before evaluating the condition. Here’s the basic syntax:

```php
do {
    // Code to execute
} while (condition);
```

Now, let’s see a simple example:

```php
$count = 1;

do {
    echo "Count: $count\n";
    $count++;
} while ($count <= 5);
```

This will output:

```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

Unlike a `while` loop, a `do...while` loop runs **at least once**, even if the condition is false.

---

## **2. Ensuring Execution at Least Once**

One key difference between `do...while` and `while` loops is that `do...while` guarantees that the code inside the loop runs at least one time. Consider this example:

```php
$count = 10;

while ($count < 5) {
    echo "This will not execute.";
}
```

Here, the condition is false from the start, so nothing happens. But with a `do...while` loop:

```php
$count = 10;

do {
    echo "This executes once even though the condition is false.";
} while ($count < 5);
```

This outputs:

```
This executes once even though the condition is false.
```

---

## **3. Using `break` and `continue` in `do...while` Loops**

Like `while` loops, `do...while` loops support `break` and `continue` for controlling the flow:

```php
$count = 1;

do {
    if ($count == 3) {
        echo "Skipping 3...\n";
        $count++;
        continue;
    }
    
    echo "Count: $count\n";
    
    if ($count == 4) {
        echo "Stopping at 4...\n";
        break;
    }
    
    $count++;
} while ($count <= 5);
```

This will output:

```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Skipping 3...
Count: 4
Stopping at 4...
```

- The `continue` statement skips the loop iteration when `$count == 3`.
- The `break` statement stops the loop when `$count == 4`.

---

## **4. Using `do...while` Loops to Process User Input**

A common use case for `do...while` loops is processing user input until valid data is received. Here’s an example using PHP’s `readline()` function:

```php
$input = "";

do {
    $input = readline("Enter a number greater than 10: ");
} while ($input <= 10);

echo "You entered: $input";
```

This ensures that the user enters a valid number before proceeding.

---

## **5. When to Use `do...while` Loops**

Use a `do...while` loop when:

- You **must** execute the loop at least once, regardless of the condition.
- You are processing user input that requires validation.
- You have logic that should always run once before checking a condition.

If you don’t need guaranteed execution, a `while` loop might be a better choice.

---

## **Conclusion**

That wraps up our session on `do...while` loops in PHP! We covered the basics, the key difference from `while` loops, using `break` and `continue`, handling user input, and when to use `do...while` loops effectively.

Try implementing `do...while` loops in your own projects and see where they can be useful! If you found this video helpful, don’t forget to like and subscribe for more PHP tutorials. Thanks for watching, and happy coding!
