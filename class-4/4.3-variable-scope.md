# 4.3 Variable Scope and the `global` Keyword

---

## **Introduction**

In our last video, we explored advanced function concepts like union types, the `mixed` type alias, and `strict_types`. Today, we’re going to discuss an important concept in PHP: variable scope. We’ll cover local and global scope, the `global` keyword, and best practices for managing variable scope. Let’s dive in!

---

## **1. Understanding Variable Scope**

In PHP, variable scope determines where a variable can be accessed. PHP has three main types of scope:

- **Local scope**: Variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function.
- **Global scope**: Variables declared outside of functions are available globally but not inside functions unless explicitly referenced.
- **Superglobals**: Built-in PHP variables like `$_POST`, `$_GET`, and `$_SESSION` that are accessible everywhere.

Let’s start with an example of local scope:

```php
function sayHello() {
    $message = "Hello from inside the function!";
    echo $message;
}

sayHello();
// echo $message; // This will cause an error since $message is not accessible outside the function.
```

## **2. Using Global Variables**

If you declare a variable outside of a function, it exists in the global scope but is not directly accessible inside functions:

```php
$siteName = "MyWebsite";

function displaySite() {
    // echo $siteName; // This will cause an error
}
```

To access a global variable inside a function, we use the `global` keyword:

```php
$siteName = "MyWebsite";

function displaySite() {
    global $siteName;
    echo "Welcome to $siteName!";
}

displaySite(); // Outputs: Welcome to MyWebsite!
```

The `global` keyword allows us to modify global variables inside a function.

## **3. Using `$GLOBALS` Superglobal**

Another way to access global variables inside functions is by using the `$GLOBALS` superglobal array. This array stores all global variables and allows access without using the `global` keyword:

```php
$counter = 1;

function incrementCounter() {
    $GLOBALS['counter']++;
}

incrementCounter();
echo $counter; // Outputs: 2
```

This method is often used when dealing with dynamically named global variables.

## **4. Best Practices for Variable Scope**

While using global variables is sometimes necessary, overusing them can lead to hard-to-maintain code. Here are some best practices:

- **Prefer function parameters**: Instead of relying on global variables, pass values as function arguments.
- **Use constants for fixed global values**: If a value should not change, define it using `define()` or `const`.
- **Limit the use of `global` and `$GLOBALS`**: These can lead to unintended side effects and should be used sparingly.

Example of a better approach using function parameters:

```php
function displaySiteName(string $name) {
    echo "Welcome to $name!";
}

displaySiteName("MyWebsite");
```

## **Conclusion**

That wraps up our session on variable scope in PHP! We covered local and global variables, the `global` keyword, and best practices for managing scope in your applications. Understanding variable scope is essential for writing clean, maintainable code.
