# 4.1 Introduction to Conditionals

In this video, we start Chapter 4 with a high-level view of decision-making
in PHP. Every program needs to choose between paths, and that choice is
always based on a boolean result.

## Decision-Making Logic

Conditionals answer a simple question: is something true or false? If the
answer is true, one block of code runs. If the answer is false, a different
block runs or nothing happens.

## Boolean Expressions

A boolean expression is any expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`.
These expressions come from comparisons, logical operators, or functions
that return boolean values.

```php
<?php
$isMember = true;
$age = 20;

$canVote = $age >= 18;
$hasAccess = $isMember && $canVote;

var_dump($canVote);   // bool(true)
var_dump($hasAccess); // bool(true)
?>
```

Even when the code looks complex, the result is still just `true` or
`false`.

## True or False at the Core

All decision-making logic in programming comes down to a single boolean
value. If you understand how PHP evaluates expressions to `true` or `false`,
conditionals become straightforward.
