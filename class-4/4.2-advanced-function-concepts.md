# 4.2 Advanced Function Concepts

---

## **Introduction**

Previously, we covered the basics of PHP functions, including defining functions, calling them, returning values, and passing parameters by reference. In this video, we’ll build upon that knowledge and explore some more advanced function features available in PHP 8.3, including union types, the `mixed` type alias, and the `strict_types` declaration. Let’s get started!

---

## **1. Enforcing Type Safety with `strict_types`**

By default, PHP performs type coercion, meaning it will try to convert values to the expected types. However, we can enforce strict type checking using the `declare(strict_types=1);` directive at the beginning of our script. This ensures that only explicitly defined types are accepted.

```php
declare(strict_types=1);

function multiply(int $a, int $b): int {
    return $a * $b;
}

$result = multiply(4, "5"); // Will throw a TypeError instead of converting "5" to an integer
```

With `strict_types=1`, PHP will throw an error if the argument does not match the expected type exactly.

---

## **2. Using Union Types**

In PHP 8.0 and later, including PHP 8.3, we can use union types to allow multiple possible types for a parameter or return value. A union type is declared using a vertical bar (`|`).

```php
function processValue(int|string $value): string {
    if (is_int($value)) {
        return "Integer: " . ($value * 2);
    }
    return "String: " . strtoupper($value);
}
```

Now, this function accepts both integers and strings:

```php
echo processValue(10);    // Outputs: Integer: 20
echo processValue("hello"); // Outputs: String: HELLO
```

Using union types makes our functions more flexible while still maintaining type safety.

## **3. The `mixed` Type Alias**

Sometimes, we may need a function that can accept and return multiple different types, including objects, arrays, or null. Instead of specifying multiple types in a union, PHP provides the `mixed` type.

```php
function handleData(mixed $data): mixed {
    if (is_array($data)) {
        return count($data);
    } elseif (is_string($data)) {
        return strtoupper($data);
    }
    return null;
}
```

Example usage:

```php
echo handleData([1, 2, 3]); // Outputs: 3
echo handleData("php");   // Outputs: PHP
echo handleData(10);        // Outputs nothing (null)
```

The `mixed` type is useful when handling dynamic data but should be used cautiously to maintain type clarity.

---

## **Conclusion**

That wraps up this session on advanced function concepts in PHP 8.3! We explored how to enforce strict typing with `strict_types`, use union types to allow multiple input types, and leverage the `mixed` type alias for handling dynamic data. These features help improve code safety and flexibility.

Try implementing these concepts in your own functions, and let me know how they work for you! If you found this video helpful, don’t forget to like and subscribe for more PHP tutorials. Thanks for watching, and happy coding!
