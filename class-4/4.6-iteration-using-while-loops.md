# 4.6 Iteration Using `while` Statements

---

## **Introduction**

In our previous video, we explored flow control using `switch` statements. Next we're going to discuss _iteration_ or _loops_, a concept that allows us to run the same code repeatedly. First, we’re going to focus on iteration using `while` loops in PHP. Loops allow us to execute a block of code multiple times as long as a specified condition remains true. Let's get started!

---

## **1. Understanding `while` Loops**

A `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as its condition evaluates to `true`. Here's the basic syntax:

```php
while (condition) {
    // Code to execute
}
```

Now, let’s see a simple example:

```php
$count = 1;

while ($count <= 5) {
    echo "Count: $count\n";
    $count++;
}
```

This will output:

```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

The loop runs as long as `$count` is less than or equal to 5, incrementing `$count` on each iteration.

---

## **2. Avoiding Infinite Loops**

Be careful with `while` loops! If the condition never becomes `false`, the loop will run indefinitely, potentially crashing your script. Here’s an example of an infinite loop:

```php
$count = 1;

while ($count <= 5) {
    echo "Count: $count\n";
    // Missing $count++ will cause an infinite loop!
}
```

Always ensure that your loop’s condition will eventually be `false` by updating the variable controlling it.

---

## **3. Using `break` and `continue` in `while` Loops**

The `break` statement exits a loop immediately, while `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one. Let’s see them in action:

```php
$count = 1;

while ($count <= 5) {
    if ($count == 3) {
        echo "Skipping 3...\n";
        $count++;
        continue;
    }
    
    echo "Count: $count\n";
    
    if ($count == 4) {
        echo "Stopping at 4...\n";
        break;
    }
    
    $count++;
}
```

This will output:

```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Skipping 3...
Count: 4
Stopping at 4...
```

- The `continue` statement skips the loop iteration when `$count == 3`.
- The `break` statement stops the loop when `$count == 4`.

---

## **4. Using `while` Loops to Process an Array**

`while` loops can be used to iterate through an array dynamically. Let’s say we have an array of names:

```php
$names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"];
$index = 0;

while ($index < count($names)) {
    echo "Name: " . $names[$index] . "\n";
    $index++;
}
```

This will output:

```
Name: Alice
Name: Bob
Name: Charlie
Name: David
```

Here, we use the `count()` function to determine the number of elements in the array and iterate through them using a `while` loop.

---

## **5. When to Use `while` Loops**

Use a `while` loop when:

- You don’t know beforehand how many times the loop will execute.
- You need to keep running a process until a condition changes.
- You’re working with user input or external data sources that require continuous checking.

If you know the number of iterations in advance, a `for` loop might be a better choice.

---

## **Conclusion**

That wraps up our session on `while` loops in PHP! We covered the basics, avoiding infinite loops, using `break` and `continue`, processing arrays, and when to use `while` loops effectively.

Try implementing `while` loops in your own projects and see how they can make your code more dynamic! If you found this video helpful, don’t forget to like and subscribe for more PHP tutorials. Thanks for watching, and happy coding!
