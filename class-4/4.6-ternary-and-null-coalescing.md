# 4.6 Ternary and Null Coalescing

In this video, we cover two compact conditional tools in PHP: the ternary
operator and the null coalescing operator. Both return values that you can
store, pass to a function, or print directly.

## The Ternary Operator

The ternary operator chooses one of two values based on a boolean
expression.

```php
<?php
$age = 20;

$status = $age >= 18 ? 'adult' : 'minor';

print $status . PHP_EOL;
?>
```

Use parentheses for clarity when the condition is complex.

```php
<?php
$score = 72;

$result = ($score >= 70 && $score < 90) ? 'pass' : 'review';

print $result . PHP_EOL;
?>
```

## The Null Coalescing Operator

The null coalescing operator (`??`) returns the first operand that is not
`null`. This is useful for defaults.

```php
<?php
$username = null;
$display = $username ?? 'Guest';

print $display . PHP_EOL;
?>
```

It also avoids notices when a variable is not set.

```php
<?php
$theme = $settings['theme'] ?? 'light';

print $theme . PHP_EOL;
?>
```

## Chaining Defaults

You can chain null coalescing to provide multiple fallbacks.

```php
<?php
$nickname = null;
$firstName = 'Ada';

$name = $nickname ?? $firstName ?? 'Student';

print $name . PHP_EOL;
?>
```

## Ternary vs. Null Coalescing

Use the ternary operator when you need a true/false decision. Use null
coalescing when you only care about whether a value is `null`.
