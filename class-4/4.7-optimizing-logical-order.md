# 4.7 Optimizing Logical Expression Order

In this video, we focus on ordering operands in logical expressions for
clarity and efficiency. PHP evaluates logical expressions left to right and
uses short-circuiting with `&&` and `||`.

## Short-Circuiting Basics

With `&&`, PHP stops evaluating as soon as a condition is false. With `||`,
PHP stops as soon as a condition is true. This behavior allows us to optimize
the order of checks.

```php
<?php
$isMember = true;
$hasPaid = false;

$canAccess = $isMember && $hasPaid;
print ($canAccess ? 'access' : 'no access') . PHP_EOL;
?>
```

## Put the Cheapest Checks First

Evaluate the simplest or least expensive checks first so PHP can stop early.

```php
<?php
$isLoggedIn = false;

if ($isLoggedIn && hasPermission()) {
    print 'Access granted.' . PHP_EOL;
}
?>
```

If `$isLoggedIn` is false, `hasPermission()` never runs.

## Put the Safest Checks First

Order conditions to avoid errors. For example, check that a value exists
before calling functions that depend on it.

```php
<?php
$username = null;

if ($username !== null && strlen($username) >= 3) {
    print 'Valid username.' . PHP_EOL;
}
?>
```

Because `$username !== null` is evaluated first, `strlen` is only called
when it is safe.

## Use Parentheses for Clarity

When mixing `&&` and `||`, add parentheses so the intent is obvious.

```php
<?php
$isMember = true;
$hasCoupon = false;
$cartTotal = 60;

if (($isMember && $cartTotal >= 50) || $hasCoupon) {
    print 'Discount applies.' . PHP_EOL;
}
?>
```

## Summary

- Logical expressions are evaluated left to right.
- Use short-circuiting to skip unnecessary work.
- Place safe, cheap checks first.
- Use parentheses to make precedence obvious.
