# 4.4 Flow Control Using `if` Statements

---

## **Introduction**

Next we’re going to discuss flow control using `if` statements in PHP. Conditional statements are a fundamental part of programming, allowing us to make decisions in our code. Let's dive in!

---

## **1. Understanding `if` Statements**

An `if` statement allows us to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true. Here’s a basic example:

```php
$age = 18;

if ($age >= 18) {
    echo "You are eligible to vote.";
}
```

If `$age` is 18 or greater, the message will be displayed. Otherwise, nothing happens.

---

## **2. Using `if-else` Statements**

Sometimes, we want to execute one block of code if a condition is true and a different block if it's false. We use `if-else` for this:

```php
$age = 16;

if ($age >= 18) {
    echo "You are eligible to vote.";
} else {
    echo "You are not old enough to vote.";
}
```

Since `$age` is 16, the `else` block executes, displaying "You are not old enough to vote."

---

## **3. Using `if-elseif-else` for Multiple Conditions**

If we need to check multiple conditions, we use `if-elseif-else`:

```php
$score = 85;

if ($score >= 90) {
    echo "Grade: A";
} elseif ($score >= 80) {
    echo "Grade: B";
} elseif ($score >= 70) {
    echo "Grade: C";
} else {
    echo "Grade: F";
}
```

Here, different messages are displayed depending on the value of `$score`.

---

## **4. Using Nested `if` Statements**

We can also nest `if` statements within each other to handle more complex conditions:

```php
$isMember = true;
$purchaseAmount = 150;

if ($purchaseAmount > 100) {
    if ($isMember) {
        echo "You get a 20% discount!";
    } else {
        echo "You get a 10% discount!";
    }
} else {
    echo "No discount available.";
}
```

Here, we check if the purchase amount exceeds 100, and then check if the user is a member to determine the discount.

## **5. Best Practices for Using `if` Statements**

To keep your code clean and efficient, follow these best practices:

- **Use clear and readable conditions**: Avoid overly complex conditions that are hard to understand.
- **Avoid deeply nested `if` statements**: Consider using functions or early returns for better readability.
- **Use `===` for strict comparisons**: This ensures type safety.
- **Use logical operators (`&&`, `||`) to simplify conditions**: Instead of nesting, combine conditions where possible.

Example:

```php
if ($isLoggedIn && $hasPermission) {
    echo "Access granted!";
}
```

## **Conclusion**

That wraps up our session on `if` statements in PHP! We covered basic `if` statements, `if-else`, `if-elseif-else`, nested conditions, and best practices for writing clean, efficient conditional logic.
