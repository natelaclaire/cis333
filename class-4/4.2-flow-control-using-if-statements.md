# 4.2 Flow Control Using `if` Statements

In this video, we cover decision-making with `if` statements in PHP. We will
start with basic `if` and `if...else`, look at nested `if` blocks, and then
use `if...elseif...else` for multiple conditions.

## Basic `if`

An `if` statement runs a block only when the condition is true.

```php
<?php
$age = 18;

if ($age >= 18) {
    print 'You are eligible to vote.' . PHP_EOL;
}
?>
```

If `$age` is 18 or greater, the message prints. Otherwise, nothing happens.

Note that you will see examples where the opening curly brace is on the next line. This is a
style choice. Both are valid in PHP. PSR-12, the PHP coding standard we follow, places the
opening brace on the same line, so we will follow that convention.

## `if...else`

Use `if...else` when you want one path for true and another for false.

```php
<?php
$age = 16;

if ($age >= 18) {
    print 'You are eligible to vote.' . PHP_EOL;
} else {
    print 'You are not old enough to vote.' . PHP_EOL;
}
?>
```

## Nested `if` Statements

You can nest `if` statements, but deep nesting becomes hard to read and is
usually an antipattern. Use nesting when it improves clarity, and avoid
unnecessary depth.

```php
<?php
$isMember = true;
$purchaseAmount = 150;

if ($purchaseAmount > 100) {
    if ($isMember) {
        print 'You get a 20% discount!' . PHP_EOL;
    } else {
        print 'You get a 10% discount!' . PHP_EOL;
    }
} else {
    print 'No discount available.' . PHP_EOL;
}
?>
```

## `if...elseif...else`

When you have multiple related conditions, use `if...elseif...else` instead
of deep nesting. It keeps the code flatter and easier to read. Each subsequent
condition is checked only if the previous ones were false.

```php
<?php
$score = 85;

if ($score >= 90) {
    print 'Grade: A' . PHP_EOL;
} elseif ($score >= 80) {
    print 'Grade: B' . PHP_EOL;
} elseif ($score >= 70) {
    print 'Grade: C' . PHP_EOL;
} else {
    print 'Grade: F' . PHP_EOL;
}
?>
```

## Curly Braces Are Optional (But Use Them)

PHP allows you to omit curly braces when the `if` body is a single line, but
this is easy to get wrong when code changes, which is why PSR-12 requires braces.
We will always use braces.

```php
<?php
if ($isLoggedIn) {
    print 'Welcome back!' . PHP_EOL;
}
?>
```

If for some reason you choose to omit braces I recommend this style as it
helps to visually remind you that braces are missing:

```php
<?php
if ($isLoggedIn) print "Welcome back!";
?>
```

Again, we will always use braces in this course as PSR-12 requires.

## Alternative Syntax for Templates

PHP supports an alternative `if...elseif...else...endif` syntax. This is most
useful when you are mixing HTML template text with PHP control structures.

```php
<?php
$loggedIn = true;
?>

<?php if ($loggedIn): ?>
    <p>Welcome back!</p>
<?php else: ?>
    <p>Please sign in.</p>
<?php endif; ?>
```

Use the alternative syntax in templates, and standard braces in regular PHP
code.
