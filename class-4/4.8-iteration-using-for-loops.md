# 4.8 Iteration Using `for` Loops

---

## **Introduction**

In our previous video, we explored iteration using `do...while` loops. Now going to focus on another type of loop in PHP: the `for` loop. `for` loops are commonly used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. Let’s get started!

---

## **1. Understanding `for` Loops**

A `for` loop is best used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a block of code. The syntax looks like this:

```php
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to execute
}
```

Let’s see an example:

```php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
    echo "Iteration: $i\n";
}
```

This will output:

```
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
Iteration: 5
```

- `$i = 1;` initializes the loop variable.
- `$i <= 5;` sets the condition to run the loop.
- `$i++` increments `$i` after each iteration.

---

## **2. Controlling Loop Execution with `break` and `continue`**

Like other loops, `for` loops can use `break` and `continue` to control execution.

```php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
    if ($i == 3) {
        echo "Skipping 3...\n";
        continue;
    }
    
    echo "Iteration: $i\n";
    
    if ($i == 4) {
        echo "Stopping at 4...\n";
        break;
    }
}
```

This will output:

```
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Skipping 3...
Iteration: 4
Stopping at 4...
```

- `continue` skips iteration when `$i == 3`.
- `break` exits the loop when `$i == 4`.

---

## **3. Using `for` Loops to Iterate Over Arrays**

`for` loops are often used to iterate over arrays using an index.

```php
$colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow"];

for ($i = 0; $i < count($colors); $i++) {
    echo "Color: " . $colors[$i] . "\n";
}
```

This will output:

```
Color: Red
Color: Green
Color: Blue
Color: Yellow
```

Here, `count($colors)` determines the array size, and the loop iterates through each element.

---

## **4. Nested `for` Loops**

`for` loops can also be nested, useful for working with multi-dimensional data like tables:

```php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 3; $i++) {
    for ($j = 1; $j <= 3; $j++) {
        echo "($i, $j) ";
    }
    echo "\n";
}
```

This will output:

```
(1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) 
(2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3) 
(3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3) 
```

Each inner loop runs completely for every iteration of the outer loop.

---

## **5. When to Use `for` Loops**

Use a `for` loop when:

- You know the number of iterations in advance.
- You need to loop through arrays using indexes.
- You’re working with numeric sequences or patterns.

If the number of iterations is unknown, a `while` or `do...while` loop might be a better choice.

---

## **Conclusion**

That wraps up our session on `for` loops in PHP! We covered the basics, using `break` and `continue`, iterating over arrays, nesting loops, and when to use `for` loops effectively.
